# The Wybe Programming Language

The Wybe programming language is intended to be easy to learn and easy to use,
but powerful and efficient enough for practical use.  It is intended to
support best programming practice, but not necessarily *common* practice.

Wybe combines the best features of declarative and imperative languages,
in particular borrowing features from functional, logic, imperative, and
object oriented languages, but does not neatly fit into any of these
paradigms.  Its main organising principle is that *values* are
immutable, but *variables* may be reassigned.  This means that values
may be passed around at will without worrying that they may be modified.


## Hello, World!

Code appearing at the top level of a file is executed when the program
is run, so Hello, World! in Wybe is quite simple:
```
# Print a friendly greeting
!println("Hello, World!")
```

Wybe comments begin with a hash (`#`) character and continue to the end
of the line.

The leading exclamation point is needed on statements that perform input/output,
and in a few other contexts that will be explained in the
[Resources](#resources) section.


## Building

Use `wybemk` to build object and executable files.  If the above program
is put in a file named `hello.wybe`, then an executable program can be
built with the command:

```
% wybemk hello
```

where '%' is your operating system prompt. This will print error messages if
there are errors in your code; otherwise it completes without printing anything,
and produces an executable program, which you can run as usual for your
operating system.

```
% ./hello
Hello, World!
```

Note that `wybemk` is like `make` in that you give it the name of the
file you want it to build, and it figures out what files it needs
to compile.


## Module items

Every Wybe source file is a module.
It may contain the following sorts of items:
statements,
function definitions,
procedure definitions,
constructor declarations,
type declarations,
resource declarations, and
module declarations.
Each of these will be described in due course.

These items are all private by default, meaning that even if the enclosing
module is imported, they will not be visible.
However, each of these sorts of items can be made public by preceding them with
the keyword `pub`, meaning that by importing the module that defines them,
you gain access to them.

To import a module into your own module, you need only include a declaration of
the form:

> `use` *module*`,` ... *module*

naming one or more modules to import.
If you precede the `use` keyword with `pub`, you automatically make any public
items in the named *module*s also visible to any module that imports the module
containing this declaration.
In effect, this re-exports everything imported from the named module(s).


##  <a name="primitives"></a>Primitive types

Wybe has the usual complement of primitive types:

| Type       | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `int`      | Fixed precision integer (32 or 64 bits)    |
| `float`    | Double precision floating point number     |
| `bool`     | Boolean; either `true` or `false`          |
| `string`   | Character string (double quotes)           |
| `char`     | Individual ascii character (single quotes) |


## Constants

Wybe also supports a conventional syntax for various constant types.

Integer constants begin with a digit character.
If the first two characters are `0x` or `0X`, then the integer is written in
hexadecimal notation (so in addition to digit characters, it may contain upper
or lower case letters `a`-`f`);
otherwise if the first character is `0`, then the integer is written in octal
notation (so it may only contain digits `0`-`7`);
otherwise it is written in decimal notation, made of any number of decimal
digits.
In any radix, underscore characters (`_`) are ignored; these may be used to
make numbers more readable, such as by grouping digits into thousands, millions,
and billions, or by grouping pairs of hexadecimal characters into bytes.

Floating point constants consist of 1 or more decimal digits followed
by a decimal point (`.`) character, followed by one or more decimal digits.
This may be followed by an `e` or `E` and one or more decimal digits specifying
a power of ten to multiply the earlier number by.
If the `e` or `E` is present, the decimal point (`.`) and fractional part may be
omitted.

The only Boolean constants are `true` and `false`.

String constants are written as any number of characters between double quote
(`"`) characters.

Character constants are written as a single character between single quote (`'`)
characters.
If the first character following the opening quote is a backslash (`\`), then
the following character is considered part of the character constant, and is
interpreted as follows:

| Character  | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `a`        | Alert or bell (ASCII code 0x07)            |
| `b`        | Backspace (ASCII code 0x08)                |
| `f`        | Formfeed (ASCII code 0x0c)                 |
| `n`        | Newline or Line feed (ASCII code 0x0a)     |
| `r`        | Carriage return (ASCII code 0x0d)          |
| `t`        | Horizontal tab (ASCII code 0x09)           |
| `v`        | Vertical tab (ASCII code 0x0b)             |

Any other character following a backslash is interpreted as itself.
In particular, `'\\'` specifies a backslash character and `'\''`
specifies a single quote character.


## Procedure calls

`!println("Hello, World!")` is a call the procedure `println` with the string
`Hello, World` as its only argument.
In general, procedure calls have the form:

> *name*`(`*arg*, ... *arg*`)`,

where *name* is the name of the procedure to call,
and each *arg* is an expression specifying an input or output
to that procedure.

A procedure call must be preceded by an exclamation point (`!`) if it uses any
resources, as described in the section on
[calling a resourceful procedure](#calling resourceful).

A procedure whose name consists of any number of the operator characters
```
~ @ $ % ^ & * - + = \ < > /
```
may use the alternative infix syntax:

> *arg* *op* *arg*,

where *op* is the procedure name (there must be exactly two arguments).


## <a name="variables"></a>Variables
The simplest form of expression is a variable reference.
Variable names begin with a letter (upper or lower case) and follow with
any number of letters, digits, and underscores.

A variable mention may *use* or *assign* its value.  If the variable
name is preceded by a question mark (`?`), the mention assigns the
variable a (new) value; without the question mark prefix, the mention
uses the variable's current value.  It does not matter which side of an
equal sign the variable appears; only its prefix determines whether the
variable is assigned or used.

```
?x = 42              # gives x the value 42
42 = ?x              # also gives x the value 42
some_proc(x, ?y, ?z) # uses x, assigns y and z
```

A variable mention may *both* use and assign its value if it is preceded
with an exclamation mark (`!`).

```
incr(!x)   # increment x (both uses and reassigns x)
```

So a variable mention without adornment is passed by value, with a `?` prefix it
is passed by result, and with a `!` prefix, it is passed by value-result.

The compiler can usually infer the type of a variable based on how it is used,
but sometimes the uses of a variable are not sufficient to determine a single
type.  In such cases, the programmer must explicitly specify the type.  In other
cases an explicit type may serve as useful documentation.  A variable's type may
be specified by following the variable name by a colon (`:`) and the variable's
intended type where the variable is first assigned.  For example, the following
code reads a single character, storing it in the variable `ch`:
```
!read(?ch:char)
```


## Function calls

A second kind of expression is a function call.
In general, these have the syntax:

> *name*`(`*arg*, ... *arg*`)`,

(that is, the same as procedure calls).
Again, each *arg* is an expression.

A function whose name consists of any number of the operator characters
```
~ @ $ % ^ & * - + = \ < > /
```
may use the alternative infix syntax:

> *arg* *op* *arg*,

where *op* is the function name (there must be exactly two arguments).


##  <a name="type constraints"></a>Type constraints
In most cases, the compiler can determine the types of expressions used in your
code.  However, occasionally the compiler needs some help in resolving
overloading.  For example, a procedure `read(?value)` may be overloaded such
that it can read various forms of input, such as integers, floating point
numbers, and strings.  If a later operation uniquely determines the
expression's type, the compiler will work this out.  However, if other
references to the variables do not uniquely determine a type, you will need to
explicitly specify the expression type.  This is done by following the expression with its type, separated by a colon, similar to the way parameter types are specified:

> *expr* `:` *type*

For example,

```
read(?value:int)
```


## Function definitions

Functions are defined with the syntax:

> `def` *name*`(`*param*`:`*type*, ... *param*`:`*type*`):`*type* `=` *expr*

Here *name* is the function name, each *param* is a parameter name, the
corresponding *type* is its type, the final *type* is the function
result type, and *expr* is an expression giving the function value.
Each `:`*type* is optional; if omitted, the compiler will infer the
type.  If there are no parameters, the parentheses are also omitted.
If the function name comprises operator characters, it should be surrounded with
backquote characters (`` ` ``).

This syntax declares a private (not exported) function.  To export the
function, the definition should be preceded by the `pub` keyword.
All types must be included in public function definitions.

For example:

```
pub def toCelsius(f:float):float = (f - 32.0) / 1.8
```


## Procedure definitions

Procedures are defined with the syntax:

> `def` *name*`(`*dir* *param*`:`*type*, ... *dir* *param*`:`*type*`) {` *body* `}`

Again *name* is the procedure name, each *param* is a parameter name, the
corresponding *type* is its type, and *body* is a sequence of statements
making up the body of the procedure.  Each *dir* is a dataflow
direction annotation, either nothing to indicate an input, `?` for an
output, or `!` to indicate both an input and an output.
Procedures may have any number of input, output, and input/output
arguments in any order.
Again each `:`*type* is optional, with types inferred if omitted,
and parentheses omitted for niladic procedures.
If the procedure name comprises operator characters, it should be surrounded
with backquote characters (`` ` ``).

The procedure is private unless preceded by the `pub` keyword.
All types must be included in public procedure definitions.

For example:

```
pub def incr(!x:int) { ?x = x + 1 }
```


## Functions *are* procedures

Wybe functions are the same as procedures with one extra output
argument, and in fact the compiler implements them that way.  Therefore,
the definition
```
pub def toCelsius(f:float):float = (f - 32.0) / 1.8
```
is exactly equivalent to
```
pub def toCelsius(f:float, ?result:float) { ?result = (f - 32.0) / 1.8 }
```

Likewise, every function call is transformed into a procedure call, so:
```
pub def example(f:float, ?c:float) {?c = toCelsius(f) }
```
is exactly equivalent to
```
pub def example(f:float, ?c:float) {toCelsius(f, ?c) }
```

This means that what you define as a procedure, you can still call as a
function whose output is the final procedure argument, and what you
define as a function, you can still call as a procedure by giving it an
extra argument to stand for the function output.  Thus

```
?y = f(x)
```
is always equivalent to
```
f(x, ?y)
```


## Modes

It is permitted to define multiple procedures with the same name, as
long as all of them have the same number and types of arguments in the
same order, and different *modes*.  A mode is a combination of argument
directions.  This can be used to carry out computations in different
directions.  For example:

```
pub def add(x:int, y:int, ?xy:int) { ?xy = x + y }
pub def add(x:int, ?y:int, xy:int) { ?y = xy - x }
pub def add(?x:int, y:int, xy:int) { ?x = xy - y }
```

Like any procedures, all of these can be called as functions, so with
these definitions, all of the following are valid:
```
?z = add(x, 1)
z = add(?x, 1)
z = add(1, ?x)
```
That is, functions can be run "backwards", if defined to support this.
In fact, `+` and `-` are already defined this way.

The compiler expects that these definitions are consistent, as they are
in this case.  That means, for example, that for any values of `a` and
`b`, after
```
add(a, b, ?ab)
add(?z, b, ab)
```
`z` would equal `a`.
The compiler is entitled to count on this equality holding, and would
actually replace the second statement with
```
?z = a
```

## Tests and partial functions

Some procedure and function calls are *tests*.  This means that instead
of returning whatever outputs they ordinarily produce, they can *fail*,
in which case they do not produce their usual output(s).  Functions
that may fail to produce a result are also known as *partial* functions.

Test procedures and functions must be explicitly declared by inserting
the modifier `test`, enclosed within curley braces, after the `def` keyword.
You can also use the modifier `partial` in place of `test`.  For example:

```
def {test} even_number(num:int) { ... }
def {partial} lookup(key:int, table:map) = ...
```

Calls to test (partial) procedures and functions are only permitted in two
contexts:  in a conditional, described [below](#conditionals),
or in the definition of a test/partial procedure or function.

Any procedure or function call can also become a test if an input is provided
where an output argument is expected.  In this case, the call is made
producing the output, and then the output is compared for equality with
supplied input.  Equality (`=`) with two input arguments is a test, so
these two calls are equivalent tests (in fact, the former is transformed to the
latter):

```
add(x, y, xy)
xy = add(x, y)
```


## <a name="conditionals"></a>Conditional statements

Wybe's conditional construct has the form:

> `if` `{` *cases* `}`

where *cases* is one more more cases, separated by vertical bar characters (`|`).
Each case takes the form:

> *test* `::` *statements*

where *test* is a test statement and *statements* is one or more statements.
Execution proceeds by executing the first *test*, and if it succeeds, executing
the corresponding *statements*, thereby completing the `if` statement.
If the first *test* fails, its corresponding *statements* are skipped and
the second *test* is tried.
If this test succeeds, its corresponding *statements* are executed, and so on.
At most one *statements* sequence is executed, but if none of the specified
*test*s succeed, none of the *statements* are executed.
The predefined `otherwise` test always succeeds, so it may be used as the final
test to provide code to execute if none of the preceding tests succeeds.

For example:
```
if { x < 0     :: !println("negative")
   | x = 0     :: !println("zero")
   | otherwise :: !println("positive")
}
```



## `terminal` and `failing` procedures
A procedure is considered to be *terminal* if a call to it will never return (it
will neither succeed nor fail). For example, the `exit` and `error` procedures
are `terminal`, as is any infinite loop. A procedure can be declared to be
terminal by following the `def` keyword with `{terminal}` in its declaration. The
Wybe compiler will verify that procedures declared `terminal` will indeed not
return.

A procedure is considered to be *failing* if is guaranteed never to succeed.  It
may fail or never return.  Wybe has a single built-in failing proc, named
`fail`, with no parameters.


## Iteration statements

Iteration is specified with the `do` statement, of the form:
> `do` `{` *statements* `}`
This executes the enclosed *statements* repeatedly, until a termination
condition is reached.

The enclosed *statements* may include any ordinary Wybe statements, plus any of
the following:

> `while` *test*

If *test* fails, exit the loop immediately, otherwise continue

> `until` *test*

If *test* succeeds, exit the loop immediately, otherwise continue

> `when` *test*

If *test* fails, restart the loop immediately, otherwise continue

> `unless` *test*

If *test* succeeds, restart the loop immediately, otherwise continue

These special loop control statements may be used anywhere inside a `do`
statement.
For example:

```
do {!print(prompt)
    !read(?response)
    until valid_answer(response)
    !println("Invalid response; please try again.")
}
```

## (sub)modules

A Wybe module may contain submodules.
Each submodule of a module has access to everything in the containing module,
whether or not it is public.
However, the parent module can only access items declared `pub`lic in its
submodules.
The parent module need not explicitly import its submodules; this is done
automatically.

A submodule is declared as follows:

> `module` *name* `{` *items* `}`

where *name* is the module name and *items* are the contents of the submodule.


## <a name="constructors"></a>Constructor declarations

Wybe supports abstract algebraic data types. Every Wybe type is a module, and
each type's primitive operations are the operations of that module. A module
becomes a type just by declaring the type's constructor(s) with a declaration of
the form:

> `constructors` *ctors*

where *ctors* is one or more constructor declarations, separated by vertical bar
characters (`|`).  Each constructor declaration takes the same form as the
prototype part of a function declaration:

> *name*`(`*param*`:`*type*, ... *param*`:`*type*`)`

This declaration defines a constructor function that takes parameters of the
specified types and returns a value of the type being defined (namely, the
current module) holding all the provided data.  Constructor functions can also
be used "backwards", with the constructed value provided and the arguments taken
as outputs, to extract the data stored in the constructed value.

The form of declaration above keeps the constructors of a type private; they may
be used within the current module, but not outside.  To make the constructors
public, simply precede the `constructor` keyword with `pub`.

Note that, unlike most Object Oriented languages, making constructors public
does not commit you to any particular representation of the type, because
constructors are not special; they are simply automatically generated functions.
You may define your own public functions to act as constructors, and they will
be indistinguishable from the actual constructors by users of the type.

As a convenience, you may use the keyword `constructor` instead of
`constructors` in the declaration; Wybe makes no distinction between them.

For example, you can make the enclosing module define a Cartesian coordinate
type with the following declaration:

```
pub constructor coordinate(x:int, y:int)
```

With this declaration,
the following statement may be used to construct a Cartesian coordinate with X
component 7 and Y component 4:
```
?pos = coordinate(7,4)
```
And this statement will unpack a coordinate `pos` into variables `x` and `y`:
```
coordinate(?x,?y) = pos
```

Additionally, two procedures are automatically generated for each *member*:
one to access the member, and one to mutate it.
The first has the prototype:

> *member*`(structure:`*type*`,` `?value:`*memtype*`)`

and the second has the form:

> *member*`(!structure:`*type*`,` `value:`*memtype*`)`

These are more conveniently used as functions, for example:
```
!print("X coordinate: ")
!println(x(pos))
x(!pos) = x(pos) + 1  # shift position to the right
```

It is important to note that "mutating" a value does not actually modify it in
place; it creates a fresh value of that type that is identical except for the
member being changed.
Wybe does not have the concept of
[object identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(object-oriented_programming)),
nor the concepts of pointers or references.
You can safely have multiple variables refer to the same data without worrying
that modifying the data through one of them will change the values of the
others.
For example
```
?pos = coordinate(7,4)
!println(x(pos))
?oldpos = pos
x(!pos) = x(pos) + 1  # shift position to the right
!println(x(pos))
!println(x(oldpos))
```
will print
```
7
8
7
```

The Wybe compiler, however, will optimise mutations when it determines that it
can safely do so.
For example, the compiler will optimise this code
```
?pos = coordinate(7,4)
!println(x(pos))
x(!pos) = x(pos) + 1  # shift position to the right
!println(x(pos))
```
so that it does in fact mutate the coordinate object in place,
saving an unnecessary object creation.

The `constructors` declaration must specify the forms of all the possible values
of that type.  Wybe does not support a special *null* or *nil* value.  For
example, you could define a binary tree type as follows:
```
constructors empty | node(left:tree, value:int, right:tree)
```
This would be written in a module named `tree`.

Deconstructing a value of a type with multiple constructors,
or accessing or altering any of its members, is a test, since the
value may not have the intended constructor.
This ensures that it is not possible to mistake a value created with one
constructor for one made with a different constructor.
In the `tree` type example, you might write:
```
def {test} member(elt:int, tree:tree) {
    if { node(?left, ?value, ?right) = tree ::
            if { elt = value:: succeed
               | elt < value:: member(elt, left)
               | otherwise  :: member(elt, right)
            }
       | otherwise:: fail
    }
}
```

## Type declarations

In some cases, a module may wish to define multiple types.  This can be done by
declaring separate submodules within the module, and declaring constructors in
each of those submodules.  As a convenience, Wybe allows the submodule and its
constructors to be declared with a single declaration of the form:

> `type` *type* `{` *ctors* *defs* `}`

where *type* is the module name and *ctors* declares one or more constructors,
separated by vertical bar characters (`|`), just as they would appear in a
`constructor` declaration.
To make the declared *type* public, precede the `type` keyword with the keyword
`pub`.
If you wish for the constructors of the type public,
precede the first constructor declaration with the `pub` keyword
(this makes all the constructors public).

The *defs* part may be empty, but if specified, may include any number of
procedure and function declarations, which will have full access to the
constructors of the type, whether or not they are public.


## <a name="generics"></a>Generic types

Wybe supports *generic* types, sometimes called *parametric polymorphism*. A
generic type is one that takes other types as parameters, specified by following
the type name with the desired parameters, separated by commas and enclosed in
parentheses. For example, the elements of a list must all be the same type, but
that can be any valid Wybe type; a list of integers can be specified by
`list(int)` and a list of lists of strings can be specified as
`list(list(string))`. This allows list operations to work with lists of any
element type, without the need to separately define different kinds of lists, or
the operations on them.

The basis of generic types is the *type variable*, which stands for a type we
don't know yet, and thus is a variable in the type system.  A type variable
follows the same naming convention as normal program variables, except they are
always preceded with a question mark.  Since we rarely have more than one or two
type variables in any given context, we conventionally use a single upper case
letter for a type variable.

Generic types are defined in the same way as described above, except that:

    * the keyword `constructor` or `constructors` is followed by a list of type
      variables separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses; and
    * these type variables may be used as types in the definitions of the
      constructors of the type.

For example, a generic list type can be defined in module `list` as:

```
constructors(?T) null | cons(head:?T, tail:list(?T))
```

If specified with a `type` declaration, this would be written:

```
type list(?T) {null | cons(head:?T, tail:list(?T)) ... }
```

All type variables appearing in the definition of any constructor must appear in
the list of type parameters.

Generic types can also be specified in procedure parameters by using type
variables.  Each occurrence of the same type variable must signify the same
type.  For example, you can define list concatenation:

```
def concat(a:list(?T), b:list(?T)):list(?T) =
    if cons(?h, ?t) = a then cons(h, concat(t,b)) else b
```

This will concatenate lists of any type, but the types of the elements of the
two input lists must be the same, and the result will be a list of the same
type.


## `this` type

As a special case, the type `this` is treated as an alias for whatever type is
defined by the module in which it appears.  That provides a (possibly) shorter
name for the type being defined, and also allows the type to be renamed simply
by renaming the file it is defined in.  For example, if the following code could
be placed in an Wybe source file to define a linked list type with whatever name
is deemed suitable.

```
constructors(?T) null | cons(head:?T, tail:this(?T))


def concat(a:this(?T), b:this(?T)):this(?T) =
    if cons(?h, ?t) = a then cons(h, concat(t,b)) else b
```


## Resources

Resources provide an alternative argument passing mechanism,
based on name rather than argument position.
They are intended for values that are unique in the computation,
where there is only one value of that sort in each part of the computation,
yet the value is used widely in the program.
For example, the command line parameters of an application may used in many
parts of the code, but explicitly passing that throughout the application
may be a nuisance.
An application may build up logging message throughout, but explicitly threading
the log through the entire application can become painful.
Resources are often useful where an imperative application would use a global or
static variable, or where an object oriented application would use a class
variable.

### Declaring a resource

The benefit of resources is that they are lightweight,
because they do not need to be explicitly passed between procedures
and their type only needs to be specified once,
Where it is declared.
Passing a value as a resource
also ensures that it is named and used consistently
throughout the module that declares it, and any modules that import it.

A resource can be declared at the level of a module, as follows:

> `resource` *name*`:`*type*

[//]: # (This does not work; see issue #7.)

[//]: # (It may optionally specify an initial value, in which case the resource is)
[//]: # (defined throughout the execution of the program.)

[//]: # (> `resource` *name*`:`*type* `=` *expr*)

A resource may be exported, allowing it to be referred to in other modules, by
preceding the `resource` declaration with the `pub` keyword.

### Defining a resourceful procedure

Any procedure may declare that it uses any number of resources,
providing the named resources are visible in the enclosing module
(i.e., defined in that module or any imported module),
by adding a `use` clause to the procedure declaration
between the procedure header and body:

> `def` *name*`(`*params*`)` `use` *dir* *resource<sub>1</sub>*, ... *dir* *resource<sub>n</sub>* `{` *body* `}`

Each *dir* indicates the direction of information flow for the indicated
resource; as for parameters, no flow prefix indicates that the resource is only
an input, a question mark (`?`) indicates only an output, and an exclamation
point (`!`) indicates that the resource is both input and output.
The order in which the resources is listed is not significant, and any number of
resources may be specified.
This allows the resource name to be used as a local variable in the procedure
body, just as if it were an ordinary parameter.

Importantly, resources available in a procedure become available in any
procedures it calls that also declare that they `use` that resource.

### <a name="calling resourceful"></a>Calling a resourceful procedure

A procedure may only be called in a context in which all the resources it uses
are defined, and a call to a resourceful procedure must be preceded by an
exclamation point (`!`) to signify that it receives inputs or produces outputs
that do not appear in its argument list.
This exclamation point serves as a warning that some values not explicitly
listed among the arguments in the call are used or defined or both, and the
declaration of the procedure must be consulted to see which values they are.

Most commonly, a procedure that uses a resource is called in the
definition of another procedure that uses that resource.
However, it may also be called from a procedure where the resource name is used
as a local variable, or inside a scoped resource use (see [below](#scoping)).

### <a name="scoping"></a>Scoping a resource use

A resource may have its value scoped to a number of statements and the
procedures called by those statements, and so on recursively.
This creates a scope in which the resource is defined;
on leaving that scope, the resource ceases to exist.

A scope introducing one or more resources may be specified with a statement of
the form:

> `use` *resource<sub>1</sub>*`,` ... *resource<sub>n</sub>* `in` `{` *body* `}`

In this case, at the start of the *body*, the resource will be undefined,
as it will at the completion of *body*.
If the resource is already defined outside the scope of the `use` statement,
the value at the start of *body* will be the same as the value before the `use`
statement, and the value at the completion of the *body* will again be the same
as the value before entering the `use` statement.
Thus a `use` statement will not alter the existence or the values of the
resources it names.

### Predefined resources

Wybe uses predefined resources for a few key language features.
In particular, the `io` resource holds a representation of the state of the
world outside the computation being performed, including the file system.
Thus all procedures that perform input/output are declared to `use !io`,
the `!` being necessary because any procedure that does I/O changes the state of
the world outside the computation, either by outputting something, or by
changing the part of an input stream being read.
Therefore, any call to a procedure that performs I/O (or that calls a procedure
that performs I/O) must be preceded with an `!` to indicate that it modifies a
resource.

The `io` resource is implicitly defined at the top level of a Wybe program.
There is also a predefined `argc` and `argv` resource holding the number of
command line arguments and an array of the arguments themselves.
Finally, the `exit_code` resource is initialised to 0 at the start of execution,
and may be changed to any integer during the computation to set the exit
condition that will be returned to the operating system at the termination of
the program.

## Low-level features (foreign interface)

### Purity

Wybe code is mostly purely logical, and the Wybe compiler takes advantage of
this.  For example, if none of the outputs of a proc call are actually used, the compiler will eliminate the call.  A proc call may also be omitted if a proc call has previously been made with the same inputs, with the compiler assuming the output(s) will be identical.  The compiler may also reorder calls however it likes, as long as all the inputs to a proc are available when the proc is called.  As long as your code is purely logical, all of these optimisations and more are perfectly safe.

However, occasionally it is important that the compiler not perform such optimisations.  For example, the `exit` command has no outputs, it is only executed for its effect (terminating the program prematurely).  In some cases, purely logical Wybe procs can be written based on impure building blocks, particularly when interfacing to code written in conventional languages.

To support such cases, the Wybe compiler provides a *purity* system, allowing you to declare the purity of your procedures and functions, which tells the Wybe compiler (and other programmers) to treat them more carefully.

Wybe supports the following three levels of purity:

- *pure*  
the default purity level.  An ordinary call, subject to omission or reordering.

- *impure*  
an impure call that should not be reordered or omitted.  Impure procs must be declared to be so, and in general, a proc that calls an impure proc must itself be impure.

- *semipure*  
a proc that behaves as impure itself, and will not be reordered or omitted, however its impurity is not "contagious".  It may be called from an ordinary, pure proc without that proc becoming impure.

In the absence of any declaration of impurity, your procedures and functions will be assumed to be pure.  An ordinary pure proc can call a semipure proc, but if it calls an impure proc, the compiler will report an error.  You can specify that your proc is pure despite calling impure procs by explicitly promising that it is pure.

Purity is managed by including one of the following modifiers, between curly braces, in the proc declaration, between the `def` keyword and the procedure or function name:

- `pure`  
promise that the proc is pure, despite calling impure procs.

- `semipure`  
specify that the proc is effectively impure, meaning that calls to it are not subject to normal optimisations, but that its callers are not rendered impure by calling it.

- `impure`  
the proc is impure, so calls to it are not subject to normal optimisations, and its callers should also be considered impure unless explicitly promised to be pure with a `pure` modifier.

Any call to an `impure` or `semipure` proc must be preceded with the `!` annotation, as if it were a call to a proc that used resources.  This reminds the reader that the call is not pure, and that they must be careful when reading or modifying the code.  For example, to prematurely exit the program, you can insert the following proc call:

```
!exit(1)
```

If you wish to include other modifiers along with one of these, include them all between the braces, in any order, separated by commas.


### Inlining

The Wybe compiler optimises your code in some situations by replacing a proc call with its definition, while being careful not to change the meaning of the program.  The compiler uses heuristics to determine when to do this, and for the most part it is not something you need to think about.

If you wish to have finer control, you can do this by placing one of these two modifiers between curly braces between `def` and the procedure or function name:

- `inline`  
force inlining of calls to this proc

- `noinline`  
prevent inlining of calls to this proc

If you wish to include other modifiers along with one of these, include them all between the braces, in any order, separated by commas.

### Foreign interface


#### Calling C code

To call C code from Wybe, use the `foreign` construct.
This is a very low-level interface, and performs no sanity checking, so be careful to get the call right.

The form of a C function call is:

> `foreign c` *function*(*arg*, *arg*, ...)

Note that, like other Wybe calls, foreign calls are assumed to be pure.  If your foreign call is performing some kind of interaction with the outside world, it should use the `io` resource, to ensure that the call is performed correctly.  This is actually quite simple:  the `io` state is simply eliminated by the compiler when it is passed in a foreign call, so you can simply pass it into and out of a foreign call, and it will vanish as the call happens, and reappear on return from the call.  For example, the `print` proc for the `char` type in the standard library is defined this way:

```
pub def print(x:char) use !io { foreign c putchar(x, !io) }
```

To improve the safety of the interface, it is recommended to define a separate Wybe proc to make each foreign call, as shown above.  This will allow the Wybe type checker to ensure the type safety of your calls, as long as your foreign call is type correct.

If your foreign call is not for communication with the outside world, then you may wish to include a purity modifier to prevent the compiler from eliminating it.  For example, the `exit` proc in the standard library is implemented as follows:

```
pub def {terminal,semipure} exit(code:int) {
    foreign c {terminal,semipure} exit(code)
}
```

(`terminal` here means that `exit` will never return to the caller; this improves Wybe's analysis of code that calls `exit`.)

#### Using LLVM instructions

The lowest-level interface is to raw LLVM instructions.  These have a functional style, although you use the procedural style if you prefer.  For example, instead of

```
?x2 = foreign llvm add(x, 1)
```
you can write
```
foreign llvm add(x, 1, ?x2)
```

For more detail on the behaviour of these operations, please consult the
[LLVM documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/).


##### Integer operations

In the following, all inputs and outputs listed as `int` can in fact be any integer type:  signed or unsigned, and any number of bits of precision.  However, all `int` inputs and outputs must be the same number of bits of precision.  All `bool` outputs may be any 1-bit integer type.

#### Foreign types

In addition to the [`constructor`](#constructors) declaration, it is possible to
declare a low-level type by specifying its representation.  This declaration has
the form:

> `representation is` *rep*

where *rep* has one of these forms:

- `address`  
the type is a machine address, similar to the `void *` type in C.
- *n* `bit` *numbertype*  
a primitive number type comprising *n* bits, where *numbertype* is one of:
  - `signed`  
  a signed integer type
  - `unsigned`  
  an unsigned integer type
  - `float`  
  a floating point number; *n* must be 16, 32, 64, or 128.

Like a `constructor` declaration, a `representation` declaration makes the
enclosing module into type.  Also like a `constructor` declaration, a submodule
declaration may be combined with the specification of a representation using the
form:

> `type` *type* `is` *rep* `{` *defs* `}`

where *rep* is as above, and *defs* specifies other members of the type.

Note that it is not permitted to specify both constructors and an explicit
representation for a type.


#### Type casting
In some cases, foreign code may need to cast values of one Wybe type to another,
to satisfy both sides of an interface.  This follows a syntax similar to
applying [type constraints](#type-constraints), except that the variable is
separated from its type with a `:!`:

> *expr* `:!` *type*

This differs from an ordinary type constraint in that:

-  this may only be used in foreign calls;
-  it may only be applied to (input or output) variables; and
-  it specifies the type of the expression without requiring that the value
   produced by the expression should be the same; ie, the type of the expression
   is *changed* to the specified type.

The final point is the key difference:  a *type constraint* specifies the what
the type of the expression must be, while a *type cast* specifies that its type
should be converted from whatever it is to the specified type.  A type
constraint will cause a type error if the specified type is incompatible with
the type of the expression, while a type cast will silently convert the type.

The behaviour of a type cast is slightly different for input and output
arguments.  In both cases, a cast specifies the type of the argument to the
foreign instruction.  For an input argument, this means you are specifying the
type *to* which the argument should be converted; for an output argument you are
specifying the type *from* which the argument should be converted.  In most
cases, for output arguments, you will want to specify the type to convert *to*.
You can do this by combining a type constraint with a type cast by following the
output variable name with a type constraint (giving the type to convert *to*),
and following that with a type cast (giving the type to convert *from*).

It is also important to understand that type casts may extend or truncate the
value being passed by adding or removing most siginficant bits to the value, but
it will not change the bits of the value.  If you wish to convert between
floating point and integer representations, see the [integer/floating point
conversion](#conversion) instructions.


#### Wybe low-level memory management primitives

The LPVM instructions are low-level memory manipulation instructions.  Note
these are foreign instructions specifying the `lpvm` (rather than `llvm`)
language. 


- `foreign lpvm alloc(`*size:*`int`, `?`*struct:type*`)`  
Allocate (at least) *size* bytes of memory and store the address in *struct*,
which has its specified type.

- `foreign lpvm access(`*struct:type*, *offset:*`int`, *size*:`int`,
                        *start_offset*:`int`, `?`*member:type2*`)`  
Access the field of type *type2* at address *struct* + *offset*. The size of the
structure is *size* bytes. The intention of the *start_offset* is to handle
tagged pointers: a tagged pointer will appear to point *start_offset* bytes past
the start of the actual structure in memory; subtracting this will allow the
start of the structure to be found, so it can be copied.

- `foreign lpvm mutate(`*struct:type*, `?`*struct2:type*,
                        *offset:*`int`, *destructive*:`bool`,
                        *size*:`int`, *start_offset*:`int`, *member:type2*`)`  
*struct2* is the same as *struct*, except that it has *member*, with type
*type2*, at *struct* + *offset*. The start of the structure is actually
*start_offset* bytes before *struct* in memory, and the size of the structure is
*size* bytes. The intention of the *start_offset* is to handle tagged pointers:
a tagged pointer will appear to point *start_offset* bytes past the start of the
actual structure in memory; subtracting this will allow the start of the
structure to be found, so it can be copied. If *destructive* is `true`, then
this instruction is permitted to perform the operation destructively, making
*struct2* the same address as *struct*.

- `foreign lpvm cast(`*var1:type1*, `?`*var2:type2*`)` Move *var1* to *var2*
converting its type from *type1* to *type2*, without changing the
representation. This just allows getting around LLVM strong typing; it does not
actually require any instructions.
