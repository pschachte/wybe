resource res:int

def {noinline} out use ?res { ?res = 11 }

use res in { 
    !out # this can be removed -- following statements overwrite only flowing global
    ?res = 10 
    !println(res) # value res can be inferred from (re)assignment
} # this whole use block can be removed -- res is definitely unchanged
