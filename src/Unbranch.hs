-- BEGIN MAJOR DOC
--  This code transforms loops into fresh recursive procs, and ensures
--  that all conditionals are the last statements in their respective
--  bodies. Note that conditionals can be nested, but at the end of
--  the conditional, they must return to the caller. This is handled
--  by introducing a fresh continuation proc for any code that follows
--  the conditional. The reason for this transformation is that a
--  later pass will convert to a logic programming form which
--  implements conditionals with separate clauses, each of which
--  returns on completion.
--
--  Loops are a little more complicated.  do {a b} c d would be
--  transformed into next1, where next1 is defined as def next1 {a b
--  next1}, and break1 is defined as def break1 {c d}.  Then Next
--  and Break are handled so that they cancel all the following code
--  in their clause body.  For example, Next a b would be transformed
--  to just next1, where next1 is the next procedure for that loop.
--  Similarly Break a b would be transformed to just break1, where
--  break1 is the break procedure for that loop.  Inside a loop, a
--  conditional must be handled specially, to support breaking out of
--  the loop.  Inside a loop, if {a:: b | otherwise:: c} d e would be
--  transformed to a call to gen1, where gen2 is defined as def gen2
--  {d e}, and gen1 is defined as def gen1 {a:: b gen2 | otherwise::
--  c gen2}.  So for example do {a if {b:: Break} c} d e would be
--  transformed into next1, which is defined as def next1 {a gen1},
--  gen1 is defined as def gen1 {b:: break1 | otherwise:: gen2},
--  gen2 is defined as def gen2 {c next1}, and break1 is defined as def
--  break1 {d e}.
--
--  The tricky part of all this is handling the arguments to these
--  generated procedures.  For each generated procedure, the input
--  parameters must be a superset of the variables used in the body of
--  the procedure, and must be a subset of the variables defined prior
--  to the generated call.  Similarly, the output parameters must be a
--  a subset of the variables defined in the generated procedure, and
--  must be superset of the variables that will be used following the
--  generated call.  Ideally, we would make these the *smallest* sets
--  satifying these constraints, but later compiler passes remove
--- unnecessary parameters, so instead we go with the largest such
--  sets.  This is determined by the type/mode checker, which already
--  keeps track of variables known to be defined at each program point.
--
--  This code also eliminates other Wybe language features, such as
--  transforming SemiDet procs into Det procs with a Boolean output
--  param.  Following unbranching, code will be compiled to LPVM
--  form by the Clause module; this requires a much simplified input
--  AST form with the following requirements:
--    * All procs, and all proc calls, are Det.
--    * All statements but the last in a body are either ProcCalls
--      or ForeignCalls or Nops.
--    * The final statement in a body can be any of these same
--      statement types, or a Cond whose condition is a single
--      TestBool, and whose branches are bodies satisfying these
--      same conditions.

-- | 'Unbranch' a single statement, given a list of following statements
--   and an already unbranched list of alternative statements. This also
--   considers the sense of the test: if True, execution should go to the
--   following statements on success and the alternative statements on
--   failure; if False, then vice-versa. The following statements are
--   represented as a pair of a list of statements that has not yet been
--   and a list of unbranched alternative statements. The alternative
--   statements will have been factored out into a call to a fresh
--   procedure if necessary (ie, if it will be used in more than one case,
--   it will be a short list).
--
--   This transforms loops into calls to freshly generated procedures that
--   implement not only the loops themselves, but all following code. That
--   is, rather than returning at the loop exit(s), the generated procs
--   call procs for the code following the loops. Similarly, conditionals
--   are transformed by generating a separate proc for the code following
--   the conditional and adding a call to this proc at the end of each arm
--   of the conditional in place of the code following the conditional, so
--   that conditionals are always the final statement in a statement
--   sequence, as are calls to loop procs.
--
--   The input arguments to generated procs are all the variables in
--   scope everywhere the proc is called. The proc generated for the code
--   after a conditional is called only from the end of each branch, so the
--   set of input arguments is just the intersection of the sets of
--   variables defined at the end of each branch. Also note that the only
--   variable defined by the condition of a conditional that can be used in
--   the 'else' branch is the condition variable itself. The condition may
--   be permitted to bind other variables, but in the 'else' branch the
--   condition is considered to have failed, so the other variables cannot
--   be used.
--
--   The variables in scope at the start of a loop are the ones in scope at
--   *every* call to the generated proc. Since variables defined before the
--   loop can be redefined in the loop but cannot become "lost", this means
--   the intersection of the variables available at all calls is just the
--   set of variables defined at the start of the loop.  The inputs to the
--   proc generated for the code following a loop is the set of variables
--   defined at every 'break' in the loop.
--
--   Because these generated procs always chain to the next proc, they don't
--   need to return any values not returned by the proc they are generated
--   for, so the output arguments for all of them are just the output
--   arguments for the proc they are generated for.
--
--   Because later compiler passes will inline simple procs and remove dead
--   code and unneeded input and output arguments, we don't bother to try
--   to optimise these things here.
